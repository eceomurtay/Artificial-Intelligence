When you run the maze_solver_xx, wait until program creates the maze. 
Then, press X to close and you will see the solution path which is drawn on the maze. 
After that, press X again to stop code run.

Program generates two mazes via 'generate(n)' function. When one maze is generated and solved, immediately other one is created.

In maze_solver_a_star, first generated maze uses Euclidean distance and second one uses Manhattan distance.
